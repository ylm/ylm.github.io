# Introduction

It is well known fact that trigonometry and complex numbers are the staple diet of an engineer. The goal of this article is to provide a starting point from which we can grow additional concepts.

# Triangle

Triangle are three edges polygone. Our interest in triangles is limited to the right triangle which has a right angle. Let's use the following triangle as a reference.

## Pythgorean identity

Pythagoras' theorem states that ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a^2%2Bb^2=c^2). While this is a good starting point in geometry, we are more interested in the trigonometric identities derived from that.
Those identities: ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sin \theta = \frac{\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}}= \frac{b}{c}) and ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\cos \theta = \frac{\mathrm{adjacent}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}}= \frac{a}{c}) allow us to get the axis components in the unit circle.

# Circle

In engineering formulas, we prefer to use radians as those relate directly to the proportion of the circle. As a circle is 360 degrees and its perimeter is equal ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C=2+\pi+R), it is no coincidence that 360 degrees equal ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2+\pi) radians. Using radians, one can easily get the length of the arc by multiplying the radius with the angle in radian.
Usually, we scale our formulas to fit within the unit circle. This allows us to easily scale measurements. From this, we understand that the unit circle's perimeter is ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2+\pi).

# Conclusion

The trigonometry identities and the unit circle are going to be the basis from which we can introduce the complex numbers.
